Kitty Munch C
=============

This is a C/C++ port of a ridiculous game that I first made in highschool 
(using Apple Basic sometime in 1984).

I'm implementing this as a means of learning about C/C++ language, libraries,
and tools (Eclipse CDT in particular).

The current implementation uses GTK APIs. I'll likely port to QT for 
cross-platform support (and to learn QT).
